<p class="poem">
  In Anahuac there reigned a king<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fifty summers old,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody darling of his gods,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sent him luck and gold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And captives from a thousand fights,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And victory in each war;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mercy kept within his heart&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trusted in his star.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But doubts began to sap his mind,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was growing old.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods he feared might turn unkind;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave them plundered gold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hung their images with hearts<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like roses on a bride,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the young slaves from the marts<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Huitzil's altars died.[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests got everything they sought.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said the gods were wroth;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had the rolls of tribute brought&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chose bales of twisted cloth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cloaks of richest feather-work,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And opals set in gilt,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a keen obsidian knife<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With carved and curious hilt,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pearls for which their wives would quarrel,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bags of cochineal,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carefully matched and scarlet coral,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chests of yellow meal,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rainbow skins of quetzal birds,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lip jewels, and each a ring;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all they gave was doubtful words&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No comfort to the king.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huitzil, they said, was sorely vexed;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tlaloc would send no rain;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more they kept the king perplexed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more they had to gain.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold I have given," said the king,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And victims for the feasts;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more is there that I can bring?"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring beauty!" said the priests.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send runners swift to each cacique[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scrolls of your command;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hut and palace bid them seek<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair virgins through the land;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bring them here and choose the maid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who most shall please your eyes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have her as your bride arrayed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And led to sacrifice."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So buzzing rumor rose and spread<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like locusts through the land;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king would choose a wife, men said:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chiefs on every hand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snatched maidens from the cotton-looms,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls, grinding maize for cakes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captives for Tenochtitlan,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city 'mid five lakes.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the causeways, borne by slaves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trembling virgins came;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the Smoking Hill that laves[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its molten sides in flame.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canoes along the causeway's sides<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept near; on rafts the throngs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned lamps to welcome home the brides;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far rowers sang strange songs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the moon was fully grown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king left his abode<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit upon the judgment throne<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set in the "Place of God,"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massive with polished seat of jade;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skull was his footstool.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arras on the wall was made<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beasts' hair wove like wool.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, while a scribe announced the dower,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women came, so fair&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young warriors whispered, and their plumes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent, nodding, as when air<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of summer stirs the fronded trees<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a mountain wall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where pigeons' wooings lull the breeze<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snow-fed rivers fall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they passed from morn till noon:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First came a princess in;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like polished bronze beneath the moon<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was her smooth, olive skin;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rumor in the market place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told of a strangled lover,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of silver masks made of his face;[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests said, "Choose another!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then daughters of rich merchants came,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dowered with silver T's.[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With downcast eyes, they were too tame;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huitzil would none of these.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And daughters of Tlascala's chiefs,[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing a precious dower&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fathers' friendship, with rich fiefs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasting a warlike power.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale girls from Huexotzinco's shades,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where willows cool the air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From far Tlaxcallan, sun-burned maids,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronzed in the cornfields there.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls from Cholula's pyramid,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born by its terraced side&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning shadows waned and hid;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king had found no bride!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a maid straight as a spear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithe as the bending maize<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When only silk is in the ear;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her eyes a haze.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked with all a panther's grace,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a pleasant tune<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice, and her round breasts were firm<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rosebuds in young June.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a cougar longs for meat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king desired the maid.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cast an arrow at her feet&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sign his choice was made.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests on twisted conch-shells blew,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouted the market place;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hatred of Huitzil seized the king;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved the maiden's face.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a huntress, fair but poor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleek puma skins her dower,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traced through the jungle by their spoor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past many a vine-closed bower,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracked to the hills and brought to bay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain by the ice-green streams,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the hissing arrow at break of day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wakened eagle screams.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the high priest found the king<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had chosen her for bride,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raged at heart to hear the thing&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No dower" hurt his pride<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And avarice; and straightway he sent<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the king's abode,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that sunset was the time<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring her to the god.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king's house rang with happiness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sound of marriage gongs;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten maidens helped the bride to dress,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While slave girls sang old songs;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was arrayed in cloaks of plumes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From birds of paradise,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woven on feather-workers' looms,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More gorgeous than bright dyes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lined with the down of humming-birds,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trimmed with the parrot's wing;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And compliments as smooth as curds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And jewels came from the king,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gifts brought by his brother's wife<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With well dissembled smile&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishes for children and long life<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whispered with subtle guile.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime the king had gone aside,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart and brain at odds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether to keep his lovely bride<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or give her to the gods.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset, in a silver litter<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brought her through the city,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still doubtful, and his heart grew bitter<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling with fear and pity.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White flowers fell before the maiden&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crushed them with his feet.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air with garden scents was laden,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad dancers filled the street.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before cruel Huitzil's pyramid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waited for the king.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved her so, fear of the gods<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now seemed a foolish thing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to laugh at and to scorn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sick thought he had dreamed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaguely recalled at early morn&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Huitzil's vengeance seemed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh courage flushed his veins, as spring<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With new sap thrills an oak,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he remembered he was king;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a word he spoke.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grim smile sat upon his face;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led her up the stair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the holy level space,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where chanting smote the air.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the fire, priests knelt in lines.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beast-mask was afoot:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayers droned like night-winds in the pines.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted with blood and soot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest cried, as though in prayer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring hither Huitzil's bride!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be swift, point out the victim, king!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she smiled by his side.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazing about with narrowed eyes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like puma's in the sun,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While priests prepared for sacrifice,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his brother's son&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How merciful to send him death<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spare him life's sure pains&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death's but a stupor at the worst,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A languor in the veins!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway he pointed out the child,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who instantly was hid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the swift dancers&mdash;in a breath<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the pyramid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They swept him to the waiting stone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull-rattles drowned his cries;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he died, he saw his heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held up before his eyes.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest raged behind his mask,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet he dared not falter.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He joined the king to Huitzil's bride<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the god's own altar,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the king's cup must be full<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vengeance would abide.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night the king laughed in his heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slept with Huitzil's bride.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The king held revels in the town<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next evening, and there came<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chieftains and minstrels of renown<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste the roasted game<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drink strong mescal to the bride,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there no priests were bid;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scowling, the high priest hied him down<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Huitzil's pyramid<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the long palace in the town,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where many litters fared,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrangling bearers set guests down,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sputtering torches flared<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fluxing light along the walls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And music's measured din<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounded above the idlers' calls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rich guests hurried in.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentries talked before the doors,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a time of gloom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest sneaked in&mdash;down corridors&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past many an empty room&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all were at the king's repast;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaves near each darkened door<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slept by their earthen lamps.  At last<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found upon the floor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of the child he'd slain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallid from many tears<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed in her agony from pain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scarcely dulls with years.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew him standing there.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was said.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face she covered with her hair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay as dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hail, mother," said the priest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your little one,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king's dead brother's son?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he sit with his uncle at the feast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence they will bring him, sleepy, to your side?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he still smiling there<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where marriage torches flare,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warriors drain the pulque to the bride?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a voice grown weak with many tears,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoke, as in a dream, and said,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours was the hand that slew him on the stone&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that he is dead."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far feasters shouted and he heard her moan.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said the priest, "Mine was the hand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the king's command, not mine he died.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died in place of Huitzil's bride<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And needs no funeral,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now he serves the gods<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high mountain glen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Huitzil sits at everlasting feast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And morning sunshine bathes the wall;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit is at peace with them."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is his body that I want,"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother said, "His little feet&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear little feet, that I shall hear no more!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each footfall was a stroke upon my heart;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice that called me 'mother' at the door;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could the gods want with my child?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shoes wait still and empty by the bed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his soft kisses I shall feel no more,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, he is gone&mdash;is dead!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the priest poured in her ear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the high gods were wronged;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he had slain the lad from fear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the bride belonged<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Huitzil&mdash;and the ruthless king<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slept in a cursèd bed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lives," she gasped&mdash;fire swept her brain&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And my sweet son is dead!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Avenge yourself!" replied the priest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arise, put gladness on,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Win near the king at his bad feast;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour before the dawn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A priest will bring the holy dish,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of your young son;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuade the king to grant this wish&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your revenge is won:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask him to let you bless the sacrifice;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you must choose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste the heart with him, lest otherwise,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspecting, he refuse;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you spread your hands to bless the dish,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless with your lips and curse within,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pray to Huitzil for revenge,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drop this in.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a subtle pearl of death;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more by her soft side<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dalliance, with deep-taken breath,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king shall seek his bride,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sleep will lead him to the couch of death,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And death to strange abodes;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you will be revenged,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall claim his loved one for the gods."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rose, and washed away her tears.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put bright colors on,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long pendant ear-rings in her ears&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the priest had gone&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clutched the poison in her hand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved to play her part,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the great door took her stand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While rage surged in her heart.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room shone with a noonday glare&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torches on silver urns&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam from hot dishes rose in air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild songs were sung by turns;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge turkeys in their feathers dressed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoked down the crowded board;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From earthen jars behind each guest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown slaves the pulque poured.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood long by the entrance door<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listened to the feast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronze spear-butts rang upon the floor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In honor to the priest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who brought the king the holy meat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot from the temple fires&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge dish to hide so small a heart!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silence!" proclaimed the criers.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest strode down the banquet hall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman following after,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chill silence fell upon them all.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave girls ceased their laughter.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set the dish down, and they heard<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mumbled words of prayer.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman stood without a word;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one could brave her stare.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a blind slave mouthed a bone.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog the silence broke&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunting in dreams, he gave a moan.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king arose and spoke.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister," he said, "what brings you here,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where weeping has no place?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you no tears for your dead child?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see none on your face."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None;" said the woman, "I have wept,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I weep no more,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tearful vigil has been kept.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children have died before!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to show all Anahuac<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No woman is above<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing her children for the gods.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty is more than love!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, give me the holy dish<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bless it to your use,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that is all I ask&mdash;a wish<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Custom can scarce refuse."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the king tried the woman's soul,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delayed, and shook his head,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held aloft the steaming bowl,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondered awhile, and said,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sup with me from the holy dish.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you but taste the heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you may bless it as you wish,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And afterward depart."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," said the woman, "I will taste<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of my own son<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may bless it; but make haste,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is nearly done."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling, he took away the cover.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a cry and start,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spread her hands and held them over<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little smoking heart.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling, she blessed with hands outspread,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But writhed and cursed within<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed for vengeance on his head&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropped the sleep-pearl in.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stifling horror in her soul,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tasted of the heart.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the king supped from the bowl,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let her straight depart.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sought her lonely, shadowed room,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, with fluttering breath,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blew the light out, and in gloom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slept to a welcome death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a slave struck upon a gong,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each guest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Departed with much talk,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some with song;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bride left with her maidens<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their rest.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the king sat sleeping there alone.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torches died away,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmering to their sockets in the stone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While far dogs bayed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last belated revelers going home.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the blind slave sat behind the door,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mumbling an endless tune,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peering with eyeballs dim;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside there sank the moon,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But light and darkness were alike to him.<br />

<p class="poem">
  And no one dared awake the king&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slept&mdash;to him it seemed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White vapor covered everything,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through its rifts there gleamed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure striding through the mist;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimly he saw the head,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white skull set with turquoise stones,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of the dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the hour before the dawn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When owlets cease to call,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put a cloak of black skins on<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And walked forth from the hall,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the terrace, down the stair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along an empty street,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the lone watchman felt his hair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise at the soundless feet.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the dying king it seemed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though he moved with ease<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a journey he had dreamed&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No weight above his knees&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from his house he passed away,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the stony strand<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the black water of the lake<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whimpered against the land.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he hailed a boatman dim<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gave a toothless scream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And motioned to wade out to him;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold as a mountain stream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the lake rise to his chin;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to strike him through<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freeze his heart&mdash;but he plunged in,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clutched the black canoe.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blind boatman helped him up,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave him a drink of blood;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the lake he tossed the cup,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight across the flood<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved like stars across the night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing a fisher's raft<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, seated by a flickering light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brown child sat and laughed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissing again her painted doll;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed at the strange sight&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadowy boatman tall&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat as black as night.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they passed fishermen's canoes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anchored in shallow spots<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nets were staked&mdash;among the crews<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fires glowed in earthen pots&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chinampas, where in tended rows[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White, cherished orchids grew.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw far mountain snows<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmer against the blue<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of night that now turned faintly gray,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wide lake grew flushed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first scarlet of the day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on they rushed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the king looked toward the shore,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw they left no wake.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long streak gleamed that shows before<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun bursts on the lake.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vague lay the city and the land,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled by a rain&mdash;or tears&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he had ruled with ruthless hand&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams mirrored back dead years:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Childhood&mdash;and little shells brought to his mother.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the beach at sunset when the lake grew dark;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young faces of his playmates in old days,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the first lusts of his strong youth.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of his first love, now long since dead;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And walks among the maize fields with his friend,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that great day the high priest hailed him king&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long lines of warriors charging home, with streaming feathers,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the neck in battle;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses and streets, and sights;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cunning thoughts, and plans that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had made in the dim city<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There across the lake,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he should see no more.</i><br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they neared a porphyry cliff<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lingered blacker night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the prow of the dark skiff<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king beheld a light<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That burned upon a landing place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a stream cleft the land,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the torch showed his nephew's face<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaded by one small hand.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the king leaped ashore,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed up the steep ravine.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naked child went on before;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pools there fell the sheen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his young body in the light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king heard his echoed calls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed after through the night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up slippery waterfalls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rough steps hollowed by the stream,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the high plateaus<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where far across the valley gleam<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iztaccihuatl's snows.[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>]<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they glowed ruddy in the dawn<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the valley, one huge cup,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay shining, city and lake and lawn;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was coming up.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning light they stood alone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a spine-like crest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the child took a jagged stone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out from his empty breast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "The gods have sent you this;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bid you to their feast.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place you will not miss:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lies due east."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the shadows of the place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to melt away<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a smile fades from the face&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the king pressed on across the plain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in long, dusty lines<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand blew, for there fell scant rain;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lizard with sharp spines<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid mid the myriad cactus thorns,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swifts would dart and cling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the toad blinked beneath his horns,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds never sing.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever the king rose higher,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where gila monsters slept by dens<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the slopes grew drier&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the huge and solitary glens,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounds of a lonely world,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About whose beetling cliffs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little clouds lay curled.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Framed at the end of one long vale<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was cleft a narrow gate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rocky entrance to the dale,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only break<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black cliffs to left and right;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked into the sky<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one square window frames the light.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this the king drew nigh.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly he heard<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of stricken metal,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a spoken word,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loud ringing gongs,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shivering clash<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cymbals, and the crash<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of drums, and timbrels with the noise<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of piping, and shrill songs of gelded boys.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around, around him swept a howling rout<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dancers in the masks of beasts,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With toss of feet and arms about<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like crazy drinkers at wild feasts;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These swept him to the gate, and there<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the rock caves fled,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving flat silence on the air<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a dumb dread.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But through the gate he made his way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut in the hill's midriff,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found the sun with whitest day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beating upon a cliff<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fell sheer to the valley dim;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the clouds would lift,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the far landscape swim<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glimmering through the rift.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, reeling from the gaping height,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back through a lava alley,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stumbling on rocks in the half-light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came into a valley,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hollow of a cup-shaped hill,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the long clouds lay<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all was gray and still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There at their everlasting feast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around a table carved about<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a tigerish beast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faces, heavy-lipped, that pout<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stone, the gods sat&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totec, parrot-faced, with stony stare,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the water goddess fat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With writhing serpents in her hair;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huitzil, with flickering plumes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of waving fire above his head,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And white-skulled Coatlicue,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of the dead;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tlaloc, god of rain, with beryl eyes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gloats on children brought<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slain to him with dismal cries,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In withering times of draught;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tezcat, lord of sharp obsidian,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Quetzalcoatl with his golden curls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worshipped at Tlacopan<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sacrifice at noontide hours<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of copal gum, while girls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring heaps of fruit and flowers.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In blue folds his snake was curled,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy snake with crest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of feathers, lord of this green world,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swathed in a rustling nest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of maize leaves&mdash;the wise god,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes the rain, and harvest wave,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the grain ripen in the pod.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a desperate courage seized the king;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped his warrior's cloak<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw away his plumes and ring,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew near, and spoke:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naked to judgment, Merciless Ones, I come,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor fear the tomb,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that what I did was done<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By your own doom."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the gods counseled among themselves,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muttering like summer thunder,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the distant earthquake delves<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the hills, and wonder<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls on the cities of the plain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the vast, rocking rumble&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then terror, and men flee in vain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the high towers tumble.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spoke the gods, and a thick gloom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came upon everything<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the serpent hissed their doom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the king.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One act of mercy spoils a life<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fragrant slaughter full.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you are nothing&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither merciless nor merciful,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your doom is this:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall be hurled<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a cliff<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this good world to nothingness."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spoke the serpent in a hiss.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Huitzil seized a monster spear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drove the king along the path.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul now first knew fear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beast laugh<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods gave&mdash;once he looked back,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But following after,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge Huitzil strode upon his track,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking with laughter.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the far valley burst upon his view<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rolling hill and plain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud-shadowed to the mountains blue.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood upon the cliff again&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tottered&mdash;and heard an eagle scream&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then suddenly he seemed to fall<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one falls in a dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the palace in the town,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king's body stirred and cried<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fearful cry, and startled slaves ran in;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rumor spread that he had died.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a loud uproar<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the priests raged outside,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with stone hammers smote upon the door<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Huitzil claimed his bride.<br />

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
